This is the code for paper ["Maximizing Approximately k-Submodular Functions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07157) (by Leqian Zheng, Hau Chan, Grigorios Loukides, Minming Li, SDM 2021).

There are two directories, each correspoding to one of the problems in our experimental evaluation section.

In each directory, you will find the code and datasets we used.

In the README file in each directory, you will find instructions to compile, configure, and run each of our algorithms.
